# Description

- **Goal:** build a model that *build a model that predicts fasting blood sugar of a patient is > 120 mg/dl*
- **Level of difficulty:** 7/10
- **Datasets:** *fbs1.xlsx, fbs2.xlsx*

7 sections with step-by-step instructions of what to do:

1. Import the libratries
2. Import the datasets
3. Data preprocessing
4. Data overview
5. Model building
6. Model evaluation & hyperparameter tuning
7. Conclusion

# Requirements
- knowledge of **syntax** *(e.g. for/while loops and if statements)*
- knowledge of **pandas** *(e.g. load the data, delete/insert column, change column name, slice/filter/merge/split a table etc.)*
- knowledge of **data types** *(e.g. object/string/int/float)*
- knowledge of what jupyter notebook is and how it works
