# Overview
Machine Learning is divided by **2** sub-fields: **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning, both related to data you use to build a model.

- **In supervised learning**, the data you use is labelled, i.e. it has a target variable $$Y$$ you need to predict, 
given the response variables $$X$$. For example, predicting price of an apartment, given such variables as: squared 
footage, number of rooms, district, area, number of schools nearby, etc.
- **In unsupervised learning**, the data you use is unlabelled, i.e. it does not have a target variable Y. An example of supervised learning is 
grouping your customers by segment, based on their characteristics (response variables).

To get a little bit ahead, let's view on the ML Mindmap, and further dissect it!

Supervised learning classified into two categories of algorithms:
- **Classification**: A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as “Red” or “blue” or “disease” and “no disease”.
- **Regression**: A regression problem is when the output variable is a real value, such as “dollars” or “weight”.



Here is the code example: 
```yaml
  - title: About
    url: /about/
```

More code:
```yaml
  - title: Contact
    url: /contact/
    button: success
```
