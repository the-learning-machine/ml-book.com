# Overview
Machine Learning consists of **2** sub-fields: supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is the learning of the model where with input variable x you can estimate output variable y.  and an output variable Y ] an algorithm to map the input to the output.

Supervised learning classified into two categories of algorithms:
- **Classification**: A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as “Red” or “blue” or “disease” and “no disease”.
- **Regression**: A regression problem is when the output variable is a real value, such as “dollars” or “weight”.

Here is the code example: 
```yaml
  - title: About
    url: /about/
```

More code:
```yaml
  - title: Contact
    url: /contact/
    button: success
```
