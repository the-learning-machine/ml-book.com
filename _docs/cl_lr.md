# Code example:

```yaml
  def function(a, b):
    h = 5
```

# THIS IS THE PIC WITH SOME TEXT AROUND: 

This is some text. This text is located over the picture, just to test if it will be looking cool and clean. Well, hence no need to read this stuff, until you like spending time on something completely useless!!

<img src="/uploads/andrew.jpeg" alt="Smiley face" align="left" height="400" width="400" > This is some text. This text is located on the right side of the picture, just to test if it will be looking cool and clean. Well, hence no need to read this stuff, until you like spending time on something completely useless!! So, it's looking good so far. Maybe we can write something under this picture, don't you think? Would be cool too!
This is some text. This text is located under the picture. BlaBla BlaBlaBla BlaBla BlaBlaBla 




# Table Examples:

| Tables   |      Are      |  Cool |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| col 1 is |  left-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is |    centered   |   $12 |
| col 3 is | right-aligned |    $1 |


More columns: 

| Tables   |      Are      |  Cool | So am I |  !   |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|--------:|-----:|
| col 1 is |  left-aligned | $1600 |   $1900 |  $16 |
| col 2 is |    centered   |   $12 |  $2200  | $16  |
| col 3 is | right-aligned |    $1 |  $3400  |  $16 |


### Equation Examples: 

Example 1:

$$
\begin{equation}
  /sum_{n=1}^i (\frac{x_i(p-0.5}{x_j(p+0.5})
\end{equation}
$$

Actual code (LateX):

```yaml
$$
\begin{equation}
  /sum_{n=1}^i (\frac{x_i(p-0.5}{x_j(p+0.5})
\end{equation}
$$
```

Example 2:

$$
\begin{align*}
  & \phi(x,y) = \phi \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_ie_i, \sum_{j=1}^n y_je_j \right)
  = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n x_i y_j \phi(e_i, e_j) = \\
  & (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
      \phi(e_1, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_1, e_n) \\
      \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      \phi(e_n, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_n, e_n)
    \end{array} \right)
  \left( \begin{array}{c}
      y_1 \\
      \vdots \\
      y_n
    \end{array} \right)
\end{align*}
$$
