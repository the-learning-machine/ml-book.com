title: What is the best/most recommended language in Deep Learning/AI?
categories: [how-to-start]

This is one of the most frequently asked questions and it re-emerged from time to time. So here are few couple of useful point of view:

In general, if you are working on computer, you will need to switch between languages from time to time. So arguing about language and which is better is not a wise thing. 

If we want to give the best advice, perhaps the answer is you should just learn as many of them as possible.
Of course, your time is limited. So we usually recommend python as your first choice. Python is cited as a good language for AI/DL because it has the best support of libraries. Most ML libraries from python links with C/C++. So you get the best of both flexibility and speed.

Other also cites Java (deeplearning4j), Lua (Torch), Lisp, Golang, R. It really depends on your purpose. Practical concerns such as code integration, your familiarity with a language usually dictates your choice. R deserves special mention because it was widely used in some brother fields such as data science and it is gaining popularity.
Finally, there is Matlab/Octave, it is also useful to learn because many Coursera ML's class is Matlab-based. e.g. Ng's class and Hinton's class. Sure, you can finish them in python, but there are much re-implementation in the process.
